This module conducts data analysis, including summarization and sentiment analysis,
on textual data collected from interviews. It uses NLP techniques to derive insights
from qualitative data.

Dependencies:
    - pandas: Used for data manipulation and aggregation.
    - textblob: Provides NLP sentiment analysis capabilities.

Project Scope:
    - Generates a statistical summary of interview data.
    - Conducts sentiment analysis at an overall and categorical level.
    - Outputs structured results that can be further processed for visualization.

Usage Example:
    >>> results = analyze_data(df)
    Analytical processing complete.

    Conducts data analysis including summarization and sentiment analysis.

    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): The dataset containing interview notes and categorical information.

    Returns:
        Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: A dictionary containing overall summaries and sentiment analysis results.
        Returns None in case of an error.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If expected columns are missing from the dataset.
        ValueError: If data contains unexpected or non-textual values.

    Example:
        >>> results = analyze_data(df)

# Suggested Improvements:
# - Consider using more advanced NLP models like VADER or Hugging Face transformers for sentiment analysis.
# - Implement error handling for edge cases where notes contain unexpected formats.
# - Cache or preprocess text data to optimize performance for large datasets.
